# Ryan Farruggia - Personal Website

This repository hosts my personal website via **Github Pages**.

## Getting Started

Multiple sections are to be included in the finalized version of this project. However, content will always be __subject to change__, as user interests begin to vary and information changes.

### Prerequisites

Cookies are used on the site to improve load times and overall experience.

```
window.open(../imgCookie.jdk);
window.replace(proxy.html);

// json files included client side
```

### Navigation

A step by step list of different pages and sections to be completed.

- [x] Home
- [x] Skills
- [x] Portfolio
- [x] My Story
- [x] Contact
- [ ] Education

### High Priority

```
// Finish Education portfolio
// Finalize education-test.htm for testing phase.
```

### Lower Priority:

```
// Move 'My Story to a new .html file to make room and reduce load times.
```

## Running tests

Running exclusive unlisted hyperlinks for best random results.

### Break down

Google Analytics installed into <head> and related scripts installed for basic data collection on user activity.

```
<link href='analytics.google.com/HASH_KEY_HIDDEN' integrity='2g5tGHU606hYtLLKm'>
```

### Backend testing

Testing backend intelligence and integrity through error log analytics and reporting.

```
<script src='analytics.google.com/users/biscuit_090/HASH_KEY_HIDDEN></script>
```
