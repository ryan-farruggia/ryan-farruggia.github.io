# Ryan Farruggia - Personal Website

This repository hosts my personal website via **Github Pages**.

## Getting Started

Multiple sections are to be included in the finalized version of this project. However, content will always be __subject to change__, as user interests begin to vary and information changes.

### Prerequisites

Cookies are used on the site to improve load times and overall experience.

```
window.open(../imgCookie.jdk);
window.replace(proxy.html);

// json files included client side
```

### Navigation

A step by step list of different pages and sections to be completed.

- [x] Home
- [x] Skills
- [x] Portfolio
- [x] My Story
- [x] Contact
- [ ] Education

```
// To do:

// Move 'My Story to a new .html file to make room and reduce load times.
// Finish Education portfolio
// Finalize education-test.htm for testing phase.
```

Lower priority:

```
// Move 'My Story to a new .html file to make room and reduce load times.
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
